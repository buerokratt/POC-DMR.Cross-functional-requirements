# Branching Strategy

This document outlines the overall branching strategy for all components repositories in the Bürokratt system.

[Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) model is used.

# TL;DR
* Short living feature branches
* Feature branch goes back to `main` branch after it passes the CI pipeline and code review.
