# ADR: Versioning strategy for containers and code packages

## Context

Currently, all containers and code packages are versioned with the full git commit SHA.  Whilst this tells us exactly which commit a package has been built from, it doesn't make the version very accessible to consumers of the package without looking into it further.

In some places, we have implemented a crude semantic version style where the version is 1.0.<github_run_number>. However, this does not allow us to easily bump major/minor versions or highlight breaking changes.

## Decision

1. Use the [GitVersion GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gittools) to implement semantic versions across all containers and applications: https://gitversion.net/docs/learn/intro-to-semver
2. Packages from `main` branch are to have a full semantic version like this: `1.2.3`
3. Packages from non-`main` branches are to have a full semantic version like this: `1.2.3-pr17.12`
   * `pr17` - denoting that the package is an output of a (hypothetical) PR #17 
   * `.12` - number pof pushes in made to the branch/PR
4. For consistency, the docker image tags should also use the same versioning strategy
5. Any package with `-suffix` after the version number is to be treated as 'prerelease' by the NuGet package manager

### Alternatives

These alternative versioning styles were considered
| Versioning strategy | Comments |
|---------------------|----------|
| `1.2.3-f6377258` | SemVer versioning with a short SHA suffix. NuGet treats versions with "-suffix" on the end as prerelease versions so this won't be appropriate for NuGet packages. |
| `1.0.<github_run_number>` | Another flavour of SemVer versioning. |

## Status

| Asset    | Implemented |
|----------|-------------|
| Buerokratt.Common library | `IN PROGRESS` |
| CentOps docker container | ❌ |
| DMR docker container | ❌ |
| MockClassifier docker container | ❌ |
| MockBot docker container | ❌ |
